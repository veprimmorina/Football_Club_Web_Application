              Albania–Kosovo relations (Albanian: Marrëdhëniet Shqiptaro-Kosovare) refer to the current, cultural and historical relations of Albania and Kosovo. Albania has an embassy in Pristina and Kosovo has an embassy in Tirana. There are 1.8 million Albanians living in Kosovo - officially 92.93% of Kosovo's entire population - and Albanian is an official language and the national language of Kosovo. Likewise, the peoples of the two countries share common traditions and folklore. Kosovo is the birthplace of Albanian nationalism such as the League of Prizren. In addiiton, the strong relations are highlighted in successive polls showing majority of ethnic Albanians in both states wanting unification. Both countries and their citizens refer to the relationship as "one nation, two states" as highlighted in the popular pan-Albanian slogan "jemi nje"(we are one).
